    New Semantic Elements: HTML 5 introduced several new semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <figure>, <figcaption>, etc., which help developers structure web pages more meaningfully and improve accessibility.

    Audio and Video Support: HTML 5 introduced native support for embedding audio and video content via the <audio> and <video> elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

    Canvas and SVG Support: HTML 5 introduced the <canvas> element for drawing graphics dynamically using JavaScript. Additionally, it provided native support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), allowing for the creation of vector graphics directly within HTML documents.

    Form Enhancements: HTML 5 introduced new input types such as email, url, tel, number, date, color, etc., making it easier to create web forms with improved validation and user experience. It also introduced the <datalist> element for providing predefined options for form inputs.

    Local Storage: HTML 5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, which allow web applications to store data locally on the user's device, enabling offline capabilities and improved performance.

    Geolocation API: HTML 5 introduced the Geolocation API, which allows web applications to access the user's geographical location, enabling location-aware services and features.

    Web Workers: HTML 5 introduced Web Workers, which enable the execution of JavaScript code in the background, separate from the main browser thread, improving performance and responsiveness in web applications.

    Improved Accessibility and Semantics: HTML 5 emphasized accessibility and semantic markup, encouraging developers to use appropriate elements and attributes to improve the accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) of web pages.

    Dropped Support for Deprecated Elements and Attributes: HTML 5 deprecated several elements and attributes from HTML 4, encouraging developers to use modern alternatives for better compatibility, performance, and maintainability.

    Backward Compatibility: HTML 5 was designed with backward compatibility in mind, ensuring that existing HTML 4 documents could still be rendered correctly in modern browsers while allowing developers to gradually adopt new HTML 5 features and enhancements.
